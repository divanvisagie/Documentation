Scalaza is an open organization focusing on Scala documentation, tutorials, and other forms of scala education. The idea was to initially be just a group to organize a Durban Scala community but we soon realised that we could expand our reach online while still being a driving force behind a Durban community of Scala developers.

Scalaza will focus on

- Curation of resources
- Creation of resources
- Events and planning (Including code of conduct and guidelines)
